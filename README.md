Hello. I'm currently creating my debut react app over at [taskslash.com](https://taskslash.com). 
I'm trying to experiment with coding and see what I like. Web development has been entertaining so far, but I'd like to check other things out.
You can reach me at [tamzidr26@gmail.com](mailto:tamzidr26@gmail.com). If you are interested in me professionally, I have a portfolio/blog over at [tamzidr.com](https://tamzidr.com).
